# uwu_Python
A Python project (forked originally from @Ayumu098 but is now non-existent) for converting text to uwu format.

This was made to make suwe the wowwd buwns with mowe cuteness! uwu

The project comes with a python module and a tkinter windows app.

To meet your uwu needs you can either run the python module in a python environment on its own, use the uwu() method in the python module for other python programs or run the python tkinter app.

The uwu() method accepts one string arg and outputs it in uwu format. If string is empty, simply returns " uwu" string.

Fast and simple access to UwU-ness. 

Next update: Add executable option for more ways to uwu!

(Kidding aside, this project was a good excuse to review on python string and tkinter.)

Hey, @mackyclemen here. This repo originally has a virtual environment initialized in here.

Make sure to set them up by initializing a virtual environment...

```bash
python -m venv .env
```

...subsequently activating the venv...


```bash
.\.venv\scripts\activate
```

...and installing requirements.

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
